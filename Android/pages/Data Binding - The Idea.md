- The big idea 
  about data binding is to create an object that connects/maps/binds two 
  pieces of distant information together at compile time, so that you 
  don't have to look for it at runtime.
- The object that surfaces these bindings to you is called the Binding object.
  It is created by the compiler, and while understanding how it works 
  under the hood is interesting, it is not necessary to know for basic 
  uses of data binding.
