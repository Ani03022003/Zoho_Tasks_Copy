- A good programming practice is keeping the instance variables as private and have getters and setters method to redistrict the access of the variable by another class.
- A class with instance variables as private and methods as public is known as strictly encapsulated class.
- to restrict the asses of a variable dont implement the setters method for example in String class there is no setter method so Strings are immutable.
- Constructors in a class share the access modifier of the class.
- Implementation of a class is encapsulation.
- Encapsulation - It is the  process of which binding the attributes(Instance variable) and behaviour(Instance methods) into a single logical unit called as class.
- After achieving strict encapsulation a class will become high cohesive and low coupled.
