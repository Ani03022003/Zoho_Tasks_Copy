- Day 2 - Chapter 2:Java language basics-1
	- Identifiers - Name given to identify a programming elements in java( Variable, class, objects, etc.,).
		- Identifier name can start with a letter ,can be underscore  or Doller symbol.
		- Can be of any length.
		- No special characters other than $ and Underscore.
		- Identifier are case sensitive.
		- Identifier names cannot be a keyword names.
		- Source File declaration rules -
			- Public class name should be the file name.
			- At most one public class can be there in the source file and that public class name should be given to the filename.
			- If the file contains only non public class then the name can be any name or any class name.
			- Imports should be between package and class.
			- Java file should be created inside a package, and must appear in the first lines, if package is not created the IDE will be creating a default package.
		- Naming conversion in java -
			- Variables name, package name, method name starts with lower case.
			- Class name can be in camelcase notation.
			- const can be in uppercase and each  word can be linked by an underscore.
	- Keywords and reversed words -
		- 51 - Keywords,  17-Reserved words
		- Keywords are predefined in the programming language.
		- Reversed words are words which are reserved for future words which means currently undefined and for future use.
	- Datatypes and Variables
		- Datatypes tells the nature of the data.
		- 8 fundamental datatypes/primitive datatypes.
			- int(4 bytes), float(4 bytes), double(8 bytes), byte(1 byte), boolean(1 bit), char(2 byte), short(2 byte), long(8 bytes).
			- in every data type one byte is reserved for signed for example 2^(8-1)=128, -128 for negative and 127 for positive.
- Leetcode problem 88.
- You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.** Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be *stored inside the array *`nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.
	- class Solution {
	- public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
	- if(m==0 && nums2.length>0){
	- int k=0;
	- for(int l=0;l<n;l++){
	- nums1[k++]=nums2[l];
	- }
	- }
	- int i=m-1,j=nums2.length-1,k=m+n-1;
	- while(j>=0){
	- if(i>=0 && nums1[i]>nums2[j]){
	- nums1[k--]=nums1[i--];
	- }
	- else{
	- nums1[k--]=nums2[j--];
	- }
	- }
	- }
	- }
