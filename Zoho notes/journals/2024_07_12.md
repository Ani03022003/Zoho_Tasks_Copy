	- Scope of variables
		- Local variable - Variable declared inside a block "{}" is called as a local variable, It will be destroyed after execution of that block. A block can contain variable declaration. Local variable must be initialized before it use (No default initialization). Local variable can share the name of instance variable. Life of a local variable is inside a block. Allocated in stack memory. When a naming conflict occurs with an instance variable, Local variable have higher preference.
		- Instance variable - Non static variables which are declared outside the method and inside the class. Instance variable can be static and non-static. Instance variable can share the name of local variable. Default value of instance variable will be 0. (int,short,byte,long-0, float-0.0f, double-0.0, boolean-false, char-''). Lifetime of Instance variable is tied to the life time of the object which is belong to. Allocated in Heap memory.
	- Access modifier - 3 access modifier( Public, Private, Protected), 4 access control(Public, Private, Protected, Default).
	- Non - Access modifier - abstract ,final ,static ,synchronized ,native ,volatile ,transient ,strictfp. final is the only access modifier which is applicable for variables.
	- Scope of a variable is where a variable is visible.
	- Memory will be allocated to a variable of a block when a control gets into a block and deallocated when control gets out of the block.
	- Implicit type conversion - small->large datatype(Widening).
	- Explicit type conversion - large->small datatype(Narrowing).

- Literals and Type, Types of Operators, Control Statements(conditional and unconditional(break, continue, return, labelled break)), Methods(All details), Static(Completely), Arrays(various ways of arrays declaration), Strings(Inbuilt methods).
